    Implementation of the "retry" feature using https://github.com/taskcluster/httpbackoff

    New authentication mechanism. The library now uses an "Authentifier interface" instead of a simple string.
    This allows for automatic re-authentication when a subscription is active (auth_revoke event type).

    For static database secret, just change your code in the following way:
    before:	ref.Auth("DBSECRET")
    after:	ref.Auth(Secret{Token: "DBSECRET"})

    Another change is that we reverse the skipKeepAlive to passKeepAlive. So now, the default is to *not*
    pass the keep-alive events.
